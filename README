ThrowApp
===============

ThrowApp is basically a pissing contest. Who can throw their phone furthest. The app uses the devices accelerometer to measure how far you throw your device.
To calculate how far you actually threw your device, we first measure how much power you use right before the phone goes weightless, and then we measure for how long your device actually is weightless. Based on these two parameters, we calculate a total score (with a pretty awesome algorithm) which gives you a pretty good indicator of how far you threw your device.

How To Build: (Netbeans)

- Create Android App named Throwapp (package: com.throwapp)
- Run: git clone https://github.com/hwestman/Throwapp.git
- Move all files from within the Throwapp dir (which you have just pulled) to the the android app directory named Throwapp
- In Netbeans you have to add the facebook android sdk like so:
	- Clone sourcee from : https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk.git
	- Update the facebook app residing in the directory you just pulled like so:
		- cd to: <your regular Android SDK>/tools
		- run: ./android update project --Throwapp --target<target> --path <path to facebook-android-sdk/facebook>
	- Add the facebook-android-sdk/facebook app to your library in Netbeans (in properties of Throwapp project)
- Build Throwapp

Tips:
- Find your available targets by running ./android list in same dir
